        <section class="content-section">
            <p>Donating blood is a noble act, but it's natural to have questions 
                or concerns. Below, we address some of the most common concerns to help you understand the process better.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Common Concerns -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Is blood donation safe?</h2>
            <p>Yes, donating blood is completely safe. Sterile, single-use needles are used for each donor, eliminating the risk of infections. Blood donation centers follow strict protocols to ensure the safety of both donors and recipients.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Does blood donation hurt?</h2>
            <p>Most donors feel a slight pinch when the needle is inserted, but the discomfort is minimal and temporary. The entire donation process takes about 10-15 minutes, and most people find it painless.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Can I donate blood if I have a medical condition?</h2>
            <p>Many medical conditions do not prevent you from donating blood. However, certain conditions and medications may temporarily or permanently prevent you from donating. It is best to consult with the donation center or a healthcare provider to determine your eligibility.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>How often can I donate blood?</h2>
            <p>You can donate whole blood every 8 weeks (56 days). Other types of donations, like platelets or plasma, have different intervals. Donation centers provide guidance on how often you can donate based on your health and type of donation.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Will donating blood make me weak?</h2>
            <p>Most healthy individuals recover from a blood donation quickly. It is recommended to drink plenty of fluids and rest for a short period after donating. Your body will replenish the donated blood within a few days.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>What if I'm afraid of needles?</h2>
            <p>It's common to feel anxious about needles. The staff at donation centers are trained to help you feel comfortable and relaxed. Inform them about your concerns, and they will provide support throughout the process.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>What happens to my blood after donation?</h2>
            <p>After donation, your blood is tested for safety and then processed into components like red cells, plasma, and platelets. These components are stored and used to help patients in need, such as those undergoing surgery, cancer treatment, or emergency care.</p>
