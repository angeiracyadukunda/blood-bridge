                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Step 1: Registration</h3>
                <!-- <img src="path/to/registration-icon.png" alt="Registration Icon" class="step-icon"> -->
                <p>Upon arrival at the donation center, you'll be greeted by our friendly staff and asked to register. This is a crucial first step, as we will collect some basic personal information, including your identification, contact details, and donation history (if applicable). The information gathered ensures that we maintain accurate records, follow safety protocols, and keep track of donations for future use. Rest assured, your personal information is kept secure and confidential, in compliance with data protection regulations.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Step 2: Health Screening</h3>
                <!-- <img src="path/to/health-screening-icon.png" alt="Health Screening Icon" class="step-icon"> -->
                <p>Before you donate, we conduct a brief health screening to ensure that both you and the recipients of your blood remain safe. This screening involves filling out a questionnaire about your medical history, lifestyle, recent travel, and any current medications. Additionally, a quick physical check will be performed, including measuring your blood pressure, pulse, hemoglobin levels, and temperature. These tests ensure that you are in good health and eligible to donate. The screening is quick, and if you are temporarily ineligible, we will explain the reasons and encourage you to try again at a later date.</p>

                <!-- <img src="path/to/donation-icon.png" alt="Donation Icon" class="step-icon"> -->
                <p>The actual blood donation process is straightforward and typically takes around 10-15 minutes. You will be seated in a comfortable chair, and our trained staff will use sterile equipment to collect your blood. We collect approximately one pint of blood, which is the standard donation amount. During the process, you can relax, read, or simply chat with the staff. If at any point you feel uneasy or experience discomfort, our staff is there to assist you and ensure that you have a positive and smooth experience. Your blood will be tested for infectious diseases before being processed for transfusion, ensuring the safety of recipients.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Step 4: Rest and Refreshments</h3>

                <p>Once your donation is complete, you will be guided to a recovery area where you can rest for about 10-15 minutes. Here, you’ll be offered light refreshments such as juice, water, or snacks to help you rehydrate and regain energy. The rest period is important to ensure that you feel well and are fully recovered before you leave. This is also a great time to relax, meet other donors, and reflect on the positive impact your donation will have on the lives of others. Our staff will keep an eye on you during this time to make sure you're feeling comfortable before you head home.</p>

                <!-- <img src="path/to/after-donation-icon.png" alt="After Donation Icon" class="step-icon"> -->
                <p>After you leave the donation center, we recommend that you take it easy for the rest of the day. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and avoid any strenuous activities, heavy lifting, or intense exercise for the next 24 hours. Your body will naturally replenish the blood you donated within a few weeks, and you can return to your normal routine in no time. Donating blood is a rewarding experience, and we hope you feel proud of your contribution. Remember to keep an eye on your donation schedule, as you can donate again after the appropriate waiting period (usually every 56 days for whole blood donations).</p>
