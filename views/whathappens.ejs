            <p>Blood donation is a crucial process that saves countless lives every day. Whether it's in emergencies, surgeries, or for chronic illnesses, donated blood plays a key role in modern medicine. Every donation can potentially save up to three lives, making it a truly impactful act of kindness. By understanding the blood donation process, you can feel confident and informed when deciding to become a donor. Let's take a look at how donated blood travels from the donor to those in need.</p>

            <p>The blood donation process is straightforward and typically takes less than an hour. It starts with registration, where donors provide personal and health information. A quick health screening follows to ensure the donor is eligible to give blood safely. The actual blood donation usually takes about 10-15 minutes. Afterwards, donors can rest, enjoy refreshments, and leave with the knowledge that their donation will help save lives.</p>

            <p>Once blood is donated, it goes through a detailed processing stage. The blood is separated into different components—red blood cells, plasma, and platelets—each of which serves specific medical needs. After separation, the components are tested for any infectious diseases, ensuring that the blood is safe for transfusion. This process is critical to maintaining the quality and safety of the blood supply, safeguarding both donors and recipients.</p>

            <p>After the blood is processed and deemed safe, it is stored in blood banks or hospitals, ready for distribution. Blood is distributed based on urgent medical needs, such as surgeries, accidents, or treating patients with conditions like anemia and cancer. The blood supply must be replenished constantly to ensure it’s available whenever needed, which is why regular donations are so important.</p>

            <img src="" alt="Use of Donated Blood" class="process-img">
            <p>Donated blood is used in various life-saving treatments. Red blood cells are often used in surgeries or for trauma patients who have lost a lot of blood. Plasma is vital for patients with severe burns or clotting disorders, and platelets are used to treat cancer patients or those undergoing chemotherapy. Blood donations truly make a difference across many medical fields and for people in urgent need of care.</p>

        <section class="safety">
            <h2>Safety Measures</h2>
            <p>The safety of both donors and recipients is a top priority throughout the blood donation process. All equipment used during donation is sterile and used only once before being safely discarded. Rigorous testing is done on all blood donations to ensure they are free of infectious diseases. Blood banks also adhere to strict storage and handling protocols to preserve the quality of donated blood. These safety measures ensure that the blood supply remains safe and reliable for those who need it.</p>
